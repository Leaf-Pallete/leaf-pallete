        A mobile menu is a navigation tool designed for smartphones and tablets,
        allowing users to access different sections of a website or app in a
        compact and user-friendly manner. It adapts to small screens and
        typically includes various styles such as:
      </p>
      <ul className="flex flex-col gap-4">
        {numberedLists.map((item) => (
          <li key={item.id}>
            <span className="font-semibold">
              {item.id} - {item.title}:
            </span>{" "}
            {item.description}
          </li>
        ))}
      </ul>
    </section>
  );
};

export default UseCases;
